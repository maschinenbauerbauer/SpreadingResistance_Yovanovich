# SpreadingResistance_Yovanovich

This code implements the calculations from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254351421_Thermal_Spreading_Resistance_of_Eccentric_Heat_Sources_on_Rectangular_Flux_Channels

This can be used to calculate the thermal spreading in an isotropic plate with an induced power via a chip interface area.

NOTE: By changing the mp.dps parameter - which defines the resolution of the numbers calculated by the numerical sums - calculation time can be reduced drastically!
